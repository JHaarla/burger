# So Many Burgers...

## Description
This is a simple app that allows the user to add a burger to the "menu", "eat" the burger and finally, throw the burger away. There is a list of available and eaten burgers. The user facing interface is geared to be fun while this full-stack app does it's magic behind the scenes.

## Under the Hood
This is a full stack application based on the MVC (Model, View, Controller) paradigm. Express.js is the backbone that interacts between the server and client side. The data is stored in a mySQL database and is manipulated per the user interactions. The client side views are handled by handlebars.
